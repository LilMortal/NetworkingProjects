Admin --> AdminDashboard : Monitor alerts and system status
Admin --> PolicyManager : Configure detection policies

VPNClient --> VPNServer : Establish VPN tunnel
VPNServer --> VPNGateway : Tunnel routing and control

VPNGateway --> TrafficMonitor : Send tunnel traffic metadata
VPNServer --> LogCollector : Send connection logs

TrafficMonitor --> AnomalyDetector : Provide traffic analysis data
LogCollector --> SignatureDetector : Provide log data
AnomalyDetector --> CorrelationModule : Send detected anomalies
SignatureDetector --> CorrelationModule : Send signature matches

CorrelationModule --> AlertManager : Trigger alerts on confirmed hijacks
AlertManager --> AdminDashboard : Display alerts
AlertManager --> AutoResponse : Trigger automatic mitigation actions

AutoResponse --> VPNGateway : Block or terminate suspicious tunnels

note right of AnomalyDetector
- Detects unusual traffic spikes, timing irregularities
- Monitors tunnel handshake anomalies
end note

note right of SignatureDetector
- Uses database of known hijacking signatures
- Matches attack patterns in VPN logs
end note

note right of CorrelationModule
- Combines anomaly and signature data
- Reduces false positives through correlation
end note

note right of AutoResponse
- Can automatically block suspicious VPN IPs
- Supports manual override by admin
end note
