Analyst --> RuleMgmt : Manage rules
Analyst --> ConfigMgr : Configure IDS/IPS
Analyst --> Dashboard : Monitor alerts & logs
RuleMgmt --> RuleSet : Update rules
NetInterface --> PacketCaptureEngine : Capture live packets
PacketCaptureEngine --> Preprocessor : Preprocess packets
Preprocessor --> DetectionEngine : Inspect packets using rules
DetectionEngine --> RuleSet : Use signature rules
Preprocessor --> AnomalyDetector : Send packets for anomaly detection
DetectionEngine --> AlertManager : Alert on signature matches
AnomalyDetector --> AlertManager : Alert on anomalies
AlertManager --> LogManager : Log alerts/events
LogManager --> Dashboard : Provide data for visualization
ReportGen --> Analyst : Provide reports

note right of PacketCaptureEngine
Uses libpcap or high-performance capture libs
end note

note right of DetectionEngine
Signature-based detection (Snort/Suricata rules)
end note

note right of AnomalyDetector
Behavioral detection for unknown threats
end note

note right of AlertManager
Handles alert thresholds and notifications
end note
