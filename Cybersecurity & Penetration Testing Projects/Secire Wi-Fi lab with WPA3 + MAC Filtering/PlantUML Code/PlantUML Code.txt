Admin --> AdminConsole : Configure WPA3 and MAC filtering
AdminConsole --> AccessPoint : Push security configurations
AuthorizedClients --> AccessPoint : Authenticate and connect (WPA3)
UnauthorizedDevices --> AccessPoint : Connection attempt blocked (MAC Filtering)
AccessPoint --> WPA3 : Enforce WPA3 encryption
AccessPoint --> MACFiltering : Apply MAC address filtering
AccessPoint --> MonitoringSystem : Send connection logs and alerts
MonitoringSystem --> Admin : Notify about unauthorized access attempts

note right of WPA3
- Uses SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)
- Provides robust encryption and forward secrecy
end note

note right of MACFiltering
- Maintains allowlist of MAC addresses
- Blocks devices not on the list
end note

note right of MonitoringSystem
- Logs all connection attempts
- Sends real-time alerts for suspicious activity
end note
