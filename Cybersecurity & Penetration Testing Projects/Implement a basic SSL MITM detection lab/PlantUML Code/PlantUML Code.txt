note right of CertValidator
Checks include:
- Certificate chain validation
- Fingerprint matching
- Expiry and issuer checks
end note

note right of AnomalyAnalyzer
Detects:
- Self-signed certs in unexpected places
- Certificate mismatch with known hosts
- Unexpected certificate changes
end note

note right of BehaviorAnalyzer
Monitors:
- SSL version downgrades
- Abnormal handshake patterns
- Traffic timing irregularities
end note
