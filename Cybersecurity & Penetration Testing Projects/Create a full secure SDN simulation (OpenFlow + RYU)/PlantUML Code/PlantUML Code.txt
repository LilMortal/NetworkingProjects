Admin --> Controller : Define security policies and network config
Controller --> Switch1 : Install flow rules via OpenFlow
Controller --> Switch2 : Install flow rules via OpenFlow

Switch1 --> Controller : Send packet-in events
Switch2 --> Controller : Send packet-in events

OFAgent1 --> Switch1
OFAgent2 --> Switch2

SecurityModule --> PolicyEngine : Evaluate policies on flows
PolicyEngine --> FlowManager : Update flow rules based on policies

TopologyManager --> FlowManager : Update network topology info
FlowManager --> OFHandler : Translate flow rules to OpenFlow messages
OFHandler --> Switch1 : Send flow mod messages
OFHandler --> Switch2 : Send flow mod messages

note right of SecurityModule
Includes:
- Intrusion detection
- Flow anomaly detection
- Access control enforcement
end note

note right of Controller
RYU controller runs custom apps:
- Topology discovery
- Flow management
- Security enforcement
end note
