title 802.1X Authentication Configuration and Flow

actor Admin as A
participant "Supplicant (Client PC)" as Client
participant "Authenticator (Switch)" as Switch
participant "RADIUS Server\n(Authentication Server)" as RADIUS

== Step 1: Configuration ==

A -> Switch: Enable 802.1X globally
Switch -> Switch: dot1x system-auth-control

A -> Switch: Configure interface for 802.1X
Switch -> Switch: interface FastEthernet0/1\n switchport mode access\n authentication port-control auto\n dot1x pae authenticator

A -> RADIUS: Configure RADIUS server
RADIUS -> RADIUS: Set client IP = Switch IP\n Shared secret = "radius123"

A -> Switch: Add RADIUS server config
Switch -> Switch: radius-server host 10.1.1.10 key radius123

== Step 2: Authentication Process ==

Client -> Switch: Link Up (EAPOL-Start)
Switch -> Client: EAP-Request/Identity
Client -> Switch: EAP-Response/Identity (e.g., user@domain)
Switch -> RADIUS: Access-Request (includes identity)

RADIUS -> Switch: Access-Challenge (e.g., EAP-MD5 challenge)
Switch -> Client: EAP-Request (MD5 challenge)
Client -> Switch: EAP-Response (MD5 hash)
Switch -> RADIUS: Access-Request (EAP response)

RADIUS -> Switch: Access-Accept (authentication success)
Switch -> Client: EAP-Success

note right of Switch
Port is now authorized\nClient has network access
end note

== Step 3: Testing & Verification ==

A -> Switch: show dot1x interface FastEthernet0/1
Switch -> A: Port status: Authorized

A -> RADIUS: Verify log\n(User authenticated successfully)

A -> Client: Attempt network access
Client -> Internet: Ping www.example.com
note right of Client
Network access succeeds
end note
