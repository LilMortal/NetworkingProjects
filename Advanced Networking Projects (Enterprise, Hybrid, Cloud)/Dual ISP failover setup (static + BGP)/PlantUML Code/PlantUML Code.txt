title Dual ISP Failover (Static + BGP) - Simplified View

actor Admin
participant "Router R1" as R1
participant "ISP A\n(Static Route)" as ISPA
participant "ISP B\n(BGP Route)" as ISPB
actor "Client" as Client

== Initial Setup ==

Admin -> R1: Configure interfaces\nG0/0 (ISP A), G0/1 (ISP B)
Admin -> R1: Add static default route to ISP A\n(ip route 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.1)
Admin -> R1: Configure BGP with ISP B\n(remote-as 65010)

R1 -> ISPB: BGP peering established

== Normal Operation ==

Client -> R1: Internet traffic
R1 -> ISPA: Route via static default
ISPA -> Internet: Forwarded

== ISP A Fails ==

ISPA -x ISPA: Link Down
R1 -> ISPB: Switch to BGP default route
ISPB -> Internet: Traffic forwarded

== ISP A Restored ==

ISPA -> R1: Link Up
R1 -> ISPA: Switches back to static route

== Verification ==

Admin -> R1: show ip route
R1 -> Admin: Static route preferred\nBGP backup active
