title GRE over IPsec Tunnel Configuration and Flow

actor Admin as A

participant "Router A" as RA
participant "Router B" as RB
database "Public Network" as Internet

== Step 1: GRE Tunnel Configuration ==

A -> RA: Define Tunnel Interface (Tunnel0)
RA -> RA: tunnel source Gig0/0\n tunnel destination RB_PUBLIC_IP\n tunnel mode gre ip\n IP address 10.0.0.1/30
A -> RB: Define Tunnel Interface (Tunnel0)
RB -> RB: tunnel source Gig0/0\n tunnel destination RA_PUBLIC_IP\n tunnel mode gre ip\n IP address 10.0.0.2/30

== Step 2: IP Routing via GRE ==

RA -> RA: Add static/OSPF route via Tunnel0
RB -> RB: Add static/OSPF route via Tunnel0

== Step 3: IPsec Phase 1 (ISAKMP/IKE) ==

RA -> RB: Initiate IKE Phase 1 (ISAKMP SA negotiation)
RB -> RA: Exchange keys and proposals
note right of RB
  Parameters:
  - Encryption: AES
  - Hash: SHA
  - DH Group: 2
  - Lifetime: 86400
end note

== Step 4: IPsec Phase 2 (IPsec SA) ==

RA -> RB: Negotiate IPsec SA for GRE traffic
RB -> RA: Agree on transform-set and ACL

== Step 5: Encrypt GRE with IPsec ==

RA -> Internet: GRE Packet → Encapsulated in ESP (IPsec)
Internet -> RB: IPsec ESP Packet
RB -> RB: Decrypt ESP → Extract GRE Packet

== Data Flow ==

A -> RA: Send routed traffic
RA -> RB: GRE over IPsec Tunnel
RB -> RB: Route to internal destination
