# GRE over IPsec Network Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

As the lead network engineer for this project, I have designed and implemented a secure site-to-site VPN solution using GRE over IPsec tunneling technology. This report documents the complete network architecture, configuration decisions, and implementation steps for establishing encrypted communication between two geographically distributed network locations.

## Network Architecture Overview

The network I designed implements a hybrid tunneling approach that combines Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) with IPsec encryption to create a secure, routable tunnel between two remote sites. This architecture provides the routing flexibility of GRE while maintaining the security benefits of IPsec encryption.

### Design Philosophy

I chose this specific architecture for several critical reasons:

1. **Routing Protocol Support**: Unlike standard IPsec tunnels, GRE supports dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP), enabling automatic route advertisement and convergence
2. **Multicast and Broadcast Support**: GRE maintains the ability to carry multicast and broadcast traffic, essential for certain network applications
3. **Security**: IPsec provides strong encryption and authentication for all tunnel traffic
4. **Scalability**: The design supports future expansion with additional sites and routing domains

## Component Analysis and Configuration

### Router A (Primary Site)
Router A serves as the primary tunnel endpoint, typically located at the headquarters or main data center. I configured it with:

- **Physical Interface**: Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 connected to the public internet
- **Tunnel Interface**: Tunnel0 configured with IP address 10.0.0.1/30
- **Role**: Initiates IPsec negotiations and maintains routing table for remote networks

### Router B (Remote Site)
Router B functions as the remote tunnel endpoint, establishing secure connectivity back to the primary site:

- **Physical Interface**: Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 for internet connectivity
- **Tunnel Interface**: Tunnel0 configured with IP address 10.0.0.2/30
- **Role**: Responds to IPsec negotiations and provides access to remote network resources

### Public Network Infrastructure
The solution leverages existing internet infrastructure as the transport medium, requiring only standard internet connectivity at both sites.

## IP Addressing and Subnetting Strategy

I implemented a structured IP addressing scheme to ensure clear network segmentation:

### Tunnel Network
- **Subnet**: 10.0.0.0/30
- **Router A Tunnel IP**: 10.0.0.1
- **Router B Tunnel IP**: 10.0.0.2
- **Rationale**: Using a /30 subnet provides exactly two usable addresses for point-to-point connectivity while conserving IP space

### Public IP Requirements
Each router requires a static public IP address for IPsec peer identification and reachability across the internet.

## Configuration Implementation

### Phase 1: GRE Tunnel Establishment

I began by configuring the GRE tunnel interfaces on both routers:

**Router A Configuration:**
```
interface Tunnel0
 tunnel source GigabitEthernet0/0
 tunnel destination [Router_B_Public_IP]
 tunnel mode gre ip
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
```

**Router B Configuration:**
```
interface Tunnel0
 tunnel source GigabitEthernet0/0
 tunnel destination [Router_A_Public_IP]
 tunnel mode gre ip
 ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
```

### Phase 2: Routing Protocol Implementation

I configured routing to enable communication through the tunnel. The implementation supports both static and dynamic routing:

**Static Routing Example:**
```
ip route [remote_network] [subnet_mask] 10.0.0.2
```

**Dynamic Routing (OSPF) Example:**
```
router ospf 1
 network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
```

### Phase 3: IPsec Security Configuration

The IPsec implementation follows a two-phase approach:

**Phase 1 (ISAKMP/IKE) Parameters:**
- Encryption Algorithm: AES
- Hash Algorithm: SHA
- Diffie-Hellman Group: Group 2
- Security Association Lifetime: 86400 seconds (24 hours)

**Phase 2 (IPsec SA) Configuration:**
- Transform Set: ESP with AES encryption and SHA authentication
- Access Control List: Defining GRE traffic for encryption
- Perfect Forward Secrecy: Enabled for enhanced security

## Traffic Flow Analysis

The network operates through a multi-step encapsulation process:

1. **Initial Traffic**: User traffic enters Router A destined for the remote network
2. **GRE Encapsulation**: Router A encapsulates the packet in GRE headers
3. **IPsec Encryption**: The GRE packet is encrypted using ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
4. **Internet Transit**: The encrypted packet travels across the public internet
5. **IPsec Decryption**: Router B decrypts the ESP packet, revealing the GRE packet
6. **GRE Decapsulation**: Router B extracts the original packet and forwards it to the destination

## Security Considerations

My security implementation addresses multiple threat vectors:

### Encryption Standards
- **AES Encryption**: Industry-standard symmetric encryption algorithm
- **SHA Hashing**: Ensures data integrity and authentication
- **DH Group 2**: Provides secure key exchange mechanism

### Access Control
- **IPsec Policies**: Restrict tunnel access to authorized networks
- **Authentication**: Pre-shared keys or digital certificates for peer verification

### Monitoring and Logging
- **IPsec Status Monitoring**: Regular verification of tunnel status
- **Traffic Analysis**: Monitoring for unusual traffic patterns
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging of tunnel establishment and failures

## Redundancy and Fault Tolerance

The design incorporates several resilience features:

### Tunnel Monitoring
- **Dead Peer Detection**: Automatic detection of failed tunnels
- **Keepalive Mechanisms**: Regular heartbeat packets to verify connectivity
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Immediate tunnel re-establishment after failures

### Backup Connectivity
- **Secondary Internet Links**: Optional backup internet connections
- **Alternative Routing**: Fallback routing via backup tunnels or alternative paths
