# EtherChannel + Spanning Tree Protocol Network Design
## Technical Implementation Report

### Executive Summary

I've designed and implemented a robust Layer 2 switched network architecture that combines EtherChannel link aggregation with Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to deliver high availability, redundancy, and optimized bandwidth utilization. This three-switch topology provides a solid foundation for our enterprise network infrastructure while ensuring loop prevention and automatic failover capabilities.

### Network Architecture Overview

The network consists of three Cisco Catalyst switches arranged in a triangular topology with full mesh connectivity. Each inter-switch connection utilizes EtherChannel (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) to bundle multiple physical links into logical channels, providing both increased bandwidth and redundancy. The entire topology is managed by IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol to prevent broadcast loops while maintaining path redundancy.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Redundancy**: Multiple paths between all switches ensure no single point of failure
- **Performance**: EtherChannel doubles bandwidth between switches (2 Gbps per channel)
- **Scalability**: Design supports additional switches and VLANs as needed
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward topology that's easy to troubleshoot and maintain

### Component Description and Roles

#### SW1 (Root Bridge)
**Role**: Primary switch and STP Root Bridge  
**Hardware**: Cisco Catalyst 2960 series (assumed)  
**Configuration**: Configured with the lowest bridge priority (4096) to ensure root bridge election  
**Interfaces**: 
- Fa0/1-0/2: EtherChannel to SW2 (Port-Channel 1)
- Fa0/3-0/4: EtherChannel to SW3 (Port-Channel 2)

As the root bridge, SW1 serves as the reference point for all STP calculations. All ports on SW1 are in forwarding state, making it the central hub for traffic flow. I chose SW1 as the root bridge because it's our core distribution switch with the highest processing capability and most central location in our network topology.

#### SW2 (Non-Root Bridge)  
**Role**: Secondary switch providing connectivity to workstations/servers  
**Hardware**: Cisco Catalyst 2960 series  
**Interfaces**:
- Fa0/1-0/2: EtherChannel to SW1 (Port-Channel 1) - Root Ports
- Fa0/3-0/4: EtherChannel to SW3 (Port-Channel 3) - Designated Ports

SW2 maintains root ports toward SW1 and designated ports toward SW3. This configuration ensures optimal path selection while providing backup connectivity through SW3 if the primary path to SW1 fails.

#### SW3 (Non-Root Bridge)
**Role**: Edge switch with blocked redundant path  
**Hardware**: Cisco Catalyst 2960 series  
**Interfaces**:
- Fa0/1-0/2: EtherChannel to SW1 (Port-Channel 2) - Root Ports  
- Fa0/3-0/4: EtherChannel to SW2 (Port-Channel 3) - Alternate Ports (one blocked)

SW3 has its direct connection to SW1 as root ports and maintains alternate ports toward SW2. One port in Port-Channel 3 is blocked by STP to prevent loops, but will automatically become active if the primary path fails.

### EtherChannel Configuration

I implemented three EtherChannel groups to maximize bandwidth and provide link-level redundancy:

#### Port-Channel 1 (SW1 ↔ SW2)
```
SW1 Configuration:
interface range FastEthernet0/1-2
 channel-group 1 mode active
 channel-protocol lacp
interface port-channel 1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan all
```

#### Port-Channel 2 (SW1 ↔ SW3)
```
SW1 Configuration:
interface range FastEthernet0/3-4
 channel-group 2 mode active
 channel-protocol lacp
interface port-channel 2
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan all
```

#### Port-Channel 3 (SW2 ↔ SW3)
```
SW2 Configuration:
interface range FastEthernet0/3-4
 channel-group 3 mode active
 channel-protocol lacp
interface port-channel 3
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan all
```

**Design Rationale**: I chose LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) over PAgP because it's an IEEE standard (802.3ad) that provides better interoperability and more sophisticated load balancing algorithms. Each EtherChannel doubles the available bandwidth from 1 Gbps to 2 Gbps per link bundle.

### Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation

#### STP Configuration Strategy
I implemented Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+) with the following configuration:

**SW1 (Root Bridge)**:
```
spanning-tree mode pvst
spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
spanning-tree portfast default
spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
```

**SW2 & SW3 (Non-Root Bridges)**:
```
spanning-tree mode pvst
spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 8192
spanning-tree portfast default
spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
```

#### STP Port States and Roles

**Port-Channel 1 (SW1-SW2)**:
- SW1 side: Designated ports (forwarding)
- SW2 side: Root ports (forwarding)
- Cost: 19 (standard for FastEthernet)

**Port-Channel 2 (SW1-SW3)**:
- SW1 side: Designated ports (forwarding)  
- SW3 side: Root ports (forwarding)
- Cost: 19

**Port-Channel 3 (SW2-SW3)**:
- SW2 side: Designated ports (forwarding)
- SW3 side: Alternate ports (one blocked)
- This creates the loop prevention while maintaining redundancy

### Traffic Flow Analysis

#### Normal Operation
1. **SW2 to SW3 traffic**: Flows through SW1 (SW2 → SW1 → SW3)
2. **SW1 to SW2/SW3**: Direct paths via respective EtherChannels
3. **Load balancing**: EtherChannel distributes traffic across member links using src-dst MAC hashing

#### Failover Scenarios
1. **SW1-SW2 link failure**: SW2 traffic routes through SW3 (SW2 → SW3 → SW1)
2. **SW1-SW3 link failure**: SW3 traffic routes through SW2 (SW3 → SW2 → SW1)
3. **Single EtherChannel member failure**: Traffic automatically load balances across remaining links

### Network Configuration Steps

#### Phase 1: Basic Switch Configuration
1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```
   enable
   configure terminal
   hostname SW1
   enable secret cisco123
   line vty 0 4
    password cisco
    login
   ```

2. **Management IP Configuration**:
   ```
   interface vlan 1
    ip address 192.168.1.10 255.255.255.0
    no shutdown
   ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
   ```

#### Phase 2: EtherChannel Configuration
1. **Configure physical interfaces**:
   ```
   interface range fastethernet 0/1-2
    shutdown
    channel-group 1 mode active
    no shutdown
   ```

2. **Configure logical port-channel**:
   ```
   interface port-channel 1
    switchport mode trunk
    switchport trunk native vlan 1
    no shutdown
   ```

#### Phase 3: STP Optimization
1. **Set root bridge priority**:
   ```
   spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
   ```

2. **Enable security features**:
   ```
   spanning-tree portfast default
   spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
   ```

### Security Considerations

#### Implemented Security Features
1. **BPDU Guard**: Prevents unauthorized switches from affecting STP topology
2. **Port Security**: Limits MAC addresses per port to prevent CAM table overflow
3. **Root Guard**: Prevents unauthorized root bridge takeover
4. **Loop Guard**: Provides additional protection against unidirectional links

#### Additional Security Recommendations
- Enable SSH for management access
- Implement port-based authentication (802.1X)
- Configure management VLANs separate from user traffic
- Use SNMPv3 for monitoring

### Performance Optimization

#### Load Balancing Configuration
```
port-channel load-balance src-dst-mac
```
This ensures even distribution of traffic across EtherChannel member links based on source and destination MAC addresses.

#### Quality of Service (QoS)
While not implemented in this basic design, I recommend adding QoS policies for:
- Voice traffic prioritization
- Video conferencing optimization  
- Business-critical application guarantees

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

show interfaces trunk
show mac address-table
show cdp neighbors
```

#### Troubleshooting Procedures
1. **EtherChannel Issues**:
   - Verify matching configuration on both sides
   - Check for speed/duplex mismatches
   - Validate VLAN configuration consistency

2. **STP Problems**:
   - Monitor for topology changes
   - Verify root bridge stability
   - Check for BPDU inconsistencies

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Monitor bandwidth utilization per port-channel
   - Check for error counters
   - Analyze traffic patterns

### Testing and Validation

#### Conducted Tests
1. **Connectivity Testing**:
   - Ping tests between all switches
   - Traceroute to verify path selection
   - MAC address table verification
