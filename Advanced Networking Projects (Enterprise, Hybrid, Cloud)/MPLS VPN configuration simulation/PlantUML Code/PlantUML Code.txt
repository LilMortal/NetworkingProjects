participant "CE1\nCustomer Edge Router Site A\n(10.1.1.1/24)" as CE1
participant "PE1\nProvider Edge Router Site A\n(VRF-A)" as PE1
participant "P1\nMPLS Core Router" as P1
participant "PE2\nProvider Edge Router Site B\n(VRF-A)" as PE2
participant "CE2\nCustomer Edge Router Site B\n(10.2.2.1/24)" as CE2
participant "BGP/MPLS Control Plane" as BGP

== Step 1: Admin configures VRFs on PE routers ==

Admin -> PE1: Configure VRF 'Customer-A'\nImport/Export Route Targets
Admin -> PE2: Configure VRF 'Customer-A'\nImport/Export Route Targets

== Step 2: CE1 advertises routes to PE1 ==

CE1 -> PE1: Advertise subnet 10.1.1.0/24

== Step 3: PE1 installs routes in VRF and advertises to BGP ==

PE1 -> BGP: Advertise VPNv4 route 10.1.1.0/24 with Route Target
BGP -> PE2: Distribute VPNv4 route 10.1.1.0/24

== Step 4: PE2 installs routes in VRF and advertises to CE2 ==

PE2 -> CE2: Advertise subnet 10.1.1.0/24 in VRF

== Step 5: CE2 sends packet to CE1 through MPLS Core ==

CE2 -> PE2: Send packet to 10.1.1.1
PE2 -> P1: Push MPLS labels and forward packet
P1 -> PE1: MPLS label switched packet
PE1 -> CE1: Forward packet in VRF to CE1

== Step 6: Return traffic from CE1 to CE2 ==

CE1 -> PE1: Send packet to 10.2.2.1
PE1 -> P1: Push MPLS labels and forward
P1 -> PE2: MPLS label switched packet
PE2 -> CE2: Deliver packet
