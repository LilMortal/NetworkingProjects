title Simulate a College Campus Network

actor Admin

participant "Core Router\n10.0.0.1" as Core
participant "Firewall/NAT\n(Internet Access)" as FW
participant "DNS/DHCP Server\n10.0.0.10" as Server
participant "Distribution Switch 1\n(Engineering)" as Dist1
participant "Distribution Switch 2\n(Science)" as Dist2
participant "Access Switch\n(Eng-Building)" as Access1
participant "Access Switch\n(Sci-Building)" as Access2
participant "Wireless Controller\n& APs" as WiFi
participant "Student Laptop\n(Eng VLAN 10)" as EngClient
participant "Staff PC\n(Sci VLAN 20)" as SciClient
participant "Lab PC\n(Admin VLAN 30)" as LabClient

== Step 1: VLAN & IP Assignment ==

Admin -> Dist1: Create VLANs 10, 20, 30
Admin -> Dist2: Same VLANs for science side
note right
VLAN 10: Students (10.10.10.0/24)\n
VLAN 20: Staff (10.10.20.0/24)\n
VLAN 30: Admin/Lab (10.10.30.0/24)
end note

== Step 2: Trunk and Access Ports ==

Dist1 -> Access1: Trunk link
Dist2 -> Access2: Trunk link

Access1 -> EngClient: Access VLAN 10
Access2 -> SciClient: Access VLAN 20

WiFi -> Dist1: Tagged traffic for VLANs 10 & 20

== Step 3: DHCP and IP Allocation ==

EngClient -> Server: DHCP Discover (VLAN 10)
Server -> EngClient: Offer IP 10.10.10.100

SciClient -> Server: DHCP Discover (VLAN 20)
Server -> SciClient: Offer IP 10.10.20.50

LabClient -> Server: DHCP Discover (VLAN 30)
Server -> LabClient: Offer IP 10.10.30.10

== Step 4: Inter-VLAN Routing & Internet Access ==

EngClient -> Core: Ping 10.10.20.50 (Staff PC)
Core -> SciClient: Route packet (inter-VLAN)

SciClient -> Core: Access Internet (8.8.8.8)
Core -> FW: NAT and Forward to Internet
FW -> Core: Response from Internet

== Step 5: DNS Resolution ==

EngClient -> Server: DNS Query for "www.college.edu"
Server -> EngClient: Reply with IP

== Step 6: WiFi Access ==

WiFi -> Server: Auth student user (RADIUS)
Server -> WiFi: Success, assign VLAN 10
