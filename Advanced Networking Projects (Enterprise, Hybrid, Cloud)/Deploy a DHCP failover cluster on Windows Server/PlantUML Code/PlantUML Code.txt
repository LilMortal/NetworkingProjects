title Deploy DHCP Failover on Windows Server (Load Balance or Hot Standby)

actor Admin as A
participant "DHCP Server 1\n(DHCP1)" as DHCP1
participant "DHCP Server 2\n(DHCP2)" as DHCP2
actor "DHCP Client" as Client

== Step 1: Install DHCP Role ==

A -> DHCP1: Install-WindowsFeature DHCP -IncludeManagementTools
A -> DHCP2: Install-WindowsFeature DHCP -IncludeManagementTools

A -> DHCP1: netsh dhcp add securitygroups
A -> DHCP2: netsh dhcp add securitygroups

A -> DHCP1: Restart-Service DHCPServer
A -> DHCP2: Restart-Service DHCPServer

== Step 2: Authorize DHCP Servers in AD ==

A -> DHCP1: netsh dhcp add server <FQDN> <IP>
A -> DHCP2: netsh dhcp add server <FQDN> <IP>

== Step 3: Create DHCP Scope on DHCP1 ==

A -> DHCP1: Create scope "OfficeLAN"\nRange: 192.168.1.100 - 192.168.1.200\nSubnet: 255.255.255.0\nGateway: 192.168.1.1

== Step 4: Configure DHCP Failover ==

A -> DHCP1: Right-click scope > Configure Failover...
DHCP1 -> DHCP2: Initiates failover partnership

note right of DHCP1
Choose Mode:\n• Load Balance (default)\n• Hot Standby
end note

DHCP2 -> DHCP1: Accepts partnership\nShares lease database

note right of DHCP2
Both servers now synchronize\nShared lease pool and states
end note

== Step 5: Client Request & Lease ==

Client -> DHCP1: DHCP Discover
DHCP1 -> DHCP2: Sync lease state (if load balance)
DHCP1 --> Client: DHCP Offer
Client -> DHCP1: DHCP Request
DHCP1 --> Client: DHCP ACK

== Step 6: Simulate DHCP1 Failure ==

DHCP1 -x DHCP1: DHCP Service Down
Client -> DHCP2: DHCP Renew Request
DHCP2 -> Client: DHCP ACK (Responds as failover partner)

note right of Client
Client lease remains valid\nNo disruption in service
end note

== Step 7: Recovery ==

DHCP1 -> DHCP2: Sync lease state after restart
DHCP2 -> DHCP1: Update leases and failover status
