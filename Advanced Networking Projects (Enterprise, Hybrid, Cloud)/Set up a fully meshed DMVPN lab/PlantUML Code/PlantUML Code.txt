actor Admin

participant "Hub Router\nPublic: 203.0.113.1\nTunnel: 10.0.0.1" as Hub
participant "Spoke1\nPublic: 198.51.100.1\nTunnel: 10.0.0.2" as Spoke1
participant "Spoke2\nPublic: 192.0.2.1\nTunnel: 10.0.0.3" as Spoke2

== Step 1: Configure Tunnel Interfaces ==

Admin -> Hub: Configure Tunnel0 (mGRE, NHRP Server)
note right of Hub
ip nhrp map multicast dynamic\n
ip nhrp network-id 1\n
ipsec transform-set and profile
end note

Admin -> Spoke1: Configure Tunnel0 (NHRP Client)
Admin -> Spoke2: Configure Tunnel0 (NHRP Client)

== Step 2: NHRP Registration ==

Spoke1 -> Hub: NHRP registration (maps 10.0.0.2 to 198.51.100.1)
Spoke2 -> Hub: NHRP registration (maps 10.0.0.3 to 192.0.2.1)

Hub -> Spoke1: NHRP Reply (registration successful)
Hub -> Spoke2: NHRP Reply (registration successful)

== Step 3: Spoke-to-Spoke Dynamic Discovery ==

Spoke1 -> Hub: NHRP Resolution Request for 10.0.0.3
Hub -> Spoke1: NHRP Reply (10.0.0.3 is at 192.0.2.1)

Spoke2 -> Hub: NHRP Resolution Request for 10.0.0.2
Hub -> Spoke2: NHRP Reply (10.0.0.2 is at 198.51.100.1)

== Step 4: Establish Direct Spoke-to-Spoke Tunnel ==

Spoke1 -> Spoke2: Initiate GRE Tunnel over IPsec
Spoke2 -> Spoke1: GRE/IPsec tunnel established

note right of Spoke1
Tunnel to 10.0.0.3\nis now direct over Internet\n(using IPsec)
end note

note right of Spoke2
Tunnel to 10.0.0.2\nis now direct over Internet\n(using IPsec)
end note

== Step 5: Full Mesh Reachability ==

Spoke1 -> Spoke2: Ping 10.0.0.3 ✓
Spoke2 -> Spoke1: Ping 10.0.0.2 ✓
Spoke1 -> Hub: Ping 10.0.0.1 ✓
Spoke2 -> Hub: Ping 10.0.0.1 ✓
