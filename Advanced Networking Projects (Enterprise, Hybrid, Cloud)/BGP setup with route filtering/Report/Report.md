## 1. Introduction to BGP and Route Filtering

### 1.1 BGP Overview

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the de facto inter-domain routing protocol used to exchange routing information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP-4, defined in RFC 4271, is a path vector protocol that maintains the path information that gets updated dynamically as the network topology changes.

**Key BGP Characteristics:**
- Uses TCP port 179 for reliable communication
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (MP-BGP)
- Implements policy-based routing decisions
- Provides loop prevention through AS-PATH attribute
- Supports various route attributes for traffic engineering

### 1.2 Route Filtering Necessity

Route filtering in BGP serves several critical purposes:

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents route hijacking and prefix hijacking attacks
- Blocks bogon prefixes and invalid routes
- Protects against routing table pollution
- Implements access control for route advertisements

**Network Optimization:**
- Reduces routing table size and memory consumption
- Improves convergence time by filtering unnecessary routes
- Enables selective route advertisement for traffic engineering
- Prevents accidental transit AS behavior

**Policy Enforcement:**
- Implements business relationships (customer, peer, provider)
- Controls route propagation based on organizational policies
- Manages bandwidth utilization and cost optimization
- Ensures compliance with peering agreements

---

## 2. Technical Architecture and Design

### 2.1 BGP Session Types

**External BGP (eBGP):**
- Established between routers in different autonomous systems
- Default AD (Administrative Distance): 20
- TTL set to 1 by default (directly connected neighbors)
- Requires explicit filtering for security and policy enforcement

**Internal BGP (iBGP):**
- Established between routers within the same autonomous system
- Default AD: 200
- Requires full mesh or route reflector hierarchy
- Inherits routes from eBGP peers with modified attributes

### 2.2 BGP Attributes and Route Selection

BGP uses multiple attributes for route selection in the following order:

1. **Weight** (Cisco-specific, local significance)
2. **Local Preference** (higher is better, iBGP only)
3. **Locally Originated Routes** (network command, redistribution, aggregation)
4. **AS-PATH Length** (shorter is better)
5. **Origin Code** (IGP < EGP < Incomplete)
6. **Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED)** (lower is better)
7. **eBGP over iBGP**
8. **Lowest IGP Metric to BGP Next Hop**
9. **Oldest Route** (for eBGP paths)
10. **Lowest Router ID**
11. **Lowest Cluster List Length**
12. **Lowest Neighbor Address**

### 2.3 Route Filtering Architecture

Route filtering can be applied at multiple points in the BGP process:

**Inbound Filtering (Before BGP Table):**
- Applied to routes received from neighbors
- Prevents unwanted routes from entering the BGP table
- Reduces memory usage and processing overhead

**Outbound Filtering (After Route Selection):**
- Applied to routes sent to neighbors
- Controls route advertisement based on policy
- Prevents accidental route leaks and transit behavior

**BGP Table Filtering:**
- Applied during route selection process
- Influences best path selection
- Uses route-maps with complex matching criteria

---

## 3. Route Filtering Methods and Mechanisms

### 3.1 Prefix-Based Filtering

**Prefix Lists:**
Prefix lists provide efficient and scalable prefix matching for route filtering.

```cisco
! IPv4 Prefix List Example
ip prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN seq 10 permit 192.168.1.0/24
ip prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN seq 20 permit 10.0.0.0/8 le 24
ip prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN seq 30 deny 0.0.0.0/0 le 32

! IPv6 Prefix List Example  
ipv6 prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN-V6 seq 10 permit 2001:db8:1::/48
ipv6 prefix-list CUSTOMER-IN-V6 seq 20 deny ::/0 le 128
```

**Standard and Extended Access Lists:**
```cisco
! Standard ACL for prefix matching
access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 10 deny any

! Extended ACL for more complex matching
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
```

### 3.2 AS-PATH Filtering

AS-PATH filtering uses regular expressions to match AS path attributes.

**Common Regular Expressions:**
- `^$` - Matches locally originated routes (empty AS path)
- `^100$` - Matches routes originating from AS 100
- `_100_` - Matches routes passing through AS 100
- `^100_` - Matches routes received directly from AS 100
- `_100$` - Matches routes originating from AS 100 (last AS)

**Configuration Example:**
```cisco
! AS-PATH Access List
ip as-path access-list 1 permit ^$
ip as-path access-list 1 deny .*

ip as-path access-list 2 permit ^65001$
ip as-path access-list 2 permit ^65002$
ip as-path access-list 2 deny .*

! Apply to BGP neighbor
router bgp 65000
 neighbor 10.1.1.1 filter-list 1 out
 neighbor 10.2.2.2 filter-list 2 in
```

### 3.3 Community-Based Filtering

BGP communities provide a way to tag routes and apply consistent policies across the network.

**Well-Known Communities:**
- `NO_EXPORT (65535:65281)` - Do not advertise to eBGP peers
- `NO_ADVERTISE (65535:65282)` - Do not advertise to any peer
- `LOCAL_AS (65535:65283)` - Do not advertise outside local AS

**Custom Communities:**
```cisco
! Community List Configuration
ip community-list standard CUSTOMER permit 65000:100
ip community-list standard PEER permit 65000:200
ip community-list standard PROVIDER permit 65000:300

! Route-map using communities
route-map OUTBOUND-POLICY permit 10
 match community CUSTOMER
 set local-preference 200

route-map OUTBOUND-POLICY permit 20
 match community PEER
 set local-preference 150

route-map OUTBOUND-POLICY permit 30
 match community PROVIDER
 set local-preference 100
```

### 3.4 Route-Maps for Advanced Filtering

Route-maps provide the most flexible filtering mechanism, allowing complex matching and attribute manipulation.

**Route-Map Structure:**
```cisco
route-map MAP-NAME [permit|deny] [sequence-number]
 match [condition]
 set [action]
```

**Comprehensive Route-Map Example:**
```cisco
! Complex route-map for inbound filtering
route-map PROVIDER-IN permit 10
 description Accept default route only
 match ip address prefix-list DEFAULT-ONLY
 set local-preference 50
 set community 65000:50

route-map PROVIDER-IN permit 20
 description Accept specific customer routes
 match ip address prefix-list CUSTOMER-PREFIXES
 match as-path 10
 set local-preference 100
 set community 65000:100

route-map PROVIDER-IN deny 30
 description Block bogon prefixes
 match ip address prefix-list BOGONS

route-map PROVIDER-IN permit 40
 description Accept all other valid routes
 match ip address prefix-list VALID-PREFIXES
 set local-preference 80
```
