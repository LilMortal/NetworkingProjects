title Full-stack ISP Simulation with Public IP Blocks

actor Admin
participant "Upstream ISP\n(Tier-1 Provider)" as Tier1
participant "ISP Core Router\n(AS 65000, BGP)" as Core
participant "ISP Edge Router\n(NAT, DHCP, DNS)" as Edge
participant "Customer Router\n(Home Gateway)" as CPE
actor "Customer Device" as User
database "ISP Services\n(DHCP, DNS, NAT Pool)" as Services
participant "Monitoring System\n(NMS, SNMP)" as Monitor

== Step 1: Public IP Block Allocation ==

Tier1 -> Core: Assigns /22 block (e.g., 203.0.113.0/22)
Tier1 -> Core: Establish BGP peering (AS 65000 ↔ AS 3356)

== Step 2: BGP Routing Setup ==

Admin -> Core: Configure BGP\nAdvertise 203.0.113.0/22
Core -> Tier1: BGP UPDATE (Origin: 203.0.113.0/22)
Tier1 -> Core: BGP Prefix ACK

== Step 3: Edge Router Setup ==

Admin -> Edge: Configure NAT pool from public /22
Edge -> Services: NAT Pool = 203.0.113.10 - 203.0.113.100

Admin -> Edge: Enable DHCP for customers\nDHCP range: 192.168.100.0/24
Edge -> Services: DHCP, DNS forwarding enabled

== Step 4: Customer Provisioning ==

CPE -> Edge: DHCP Discover
Edge -> CPE: DHCP Offer (192.168.100.10)
CPE -> Edge: DHCP Request
Edge -> CPE: DHCP ACK

CPE -> Services: DNS query (e.g., www.example.com)
Services -> CPE: DNS Response (93.184.216.34)

== Step 5: Internet Access Flow ==

User -> CPE: HTTP Request
CPE -> Edge: Forward packet (192.168.100.10 → Internet)
Edge -> Services: NAT applied (203.0.113.10)
Edge -> Core: Packet routed to Tier1
Core -> Tier1: Forwards to Internet

== Step 6: Monitoring and Logs ==

Edge -> Monitor: SNMP Traps, NetFlow
Core -> Monitor: BGP state, interface stats
Services -> Monitor: DHCP logs, DNS stats

Admin -> Monitor: View usage reports, alerts
