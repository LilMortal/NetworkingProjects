actor Admin

participant "R1\nArea 0 Backbone Router" as R1
participant "R4\nABR Area 0 & 1" as R4
participant "R6\nABR Area 0 & 2" as R6
participant "R2\nArea 1 Router" as R2
participant "R3\nArea 1 Router" as R3
participant "R5\nArea 2 Router" as R5

== Step 1: OSPF Neighbor Formation ==

R1 -> R4: Form OSPF adjacency in Area 0
R4 -> R6: Form OSPF adjacency in Area 0
R4 -> R2: Form OSPF adjacency in Area 1
R4 -> R3: Form OSPF adjacency in Area 1
R6 -> R5: Form OSPF adjacency in Area 2

== Step 2: Intra-area LSAs (Link State Advertisements) ==

R2 -> R4: Advertise subnet 10.1.1.0/24 in Area 1
R3 -> R4: Advertise subnet 10.1.2.0/24 in Area 1
R5 -> R6: Advertise subnet 10.2.1.0/24 in Area 2

== Step 3: Route Summarization at ABRs ==

note right of R4
Summarize Area 1 routes:\n
10.1.0.0/16 advertised to Area 0
end note

note right of R6
Summarize Area 2 routes:\n
10.2.0.0/16 advertised to Area 0
end note

R4 -> R1: Advertise summarized route 10.1.0.0/16 in Area 0
R6 -> R1: Advertise summarized route 10.2.0.0/16 in Area 0

== Step 4: Route Propagation in Area 0 ==

R1 -> R4: Confirm route receipt
R1 -> R6: Confirm route receipt

== Step 5: Backbone to Areas Route Advertisement ==

R1 -> R4: Advertise default route or other area routes
R1 -> R6: Advertise default route or other area routes

R4 -> R2: Forward summarized and backbone routes
R6 -> R5: Forward summarized and backbone routes
