' Network devices
node "Router/Switch\nQoS Device" as Device

' Traffic sources
rectangle "Voice Traffic\n(SIP, RTP)\nUDP ports 5060, 10000-20000" as VoiceTraffic
rectangle "Video Traffic\n(RTSP, RTP)\nUDP ports 554, 10000-20000" as VideoTraffic
rectangle "Data Traffic\n(HTTP, FTP, etc.)" as DataTraffic

' Traffic flows into device
VoiceTraffic --> Device : Mark DSCP EF (Expedited Forwarding)
VideoTraffic --> Device : Mark DSCP AF41/AF42 (Assured Forwarding)
DataTraffic --> Device : Default DSCP / Best Effort

' QoS Components on device
rectangle "Class Maps\n- Match Voice\n- Match Video\n- Match Data" as ClassMaps
rectangle "Policy Map\n- Priority Queue (Voice)\n- Bandwidth Guarantee (Video)\n- Weighted Fair Queue (Data)" as PolicyMap
rectangle "Interface\n- Apply Service Policy Inbound/Outbound" as Interface

' Flow through QoS components
Device --> ClassMaps : Traffic classification
ClassMaps --> PolicyMap : Define actions per class
PolicyMap --> Interface : Attach policy to interface

' Additional notes on QoS
note right of PolicyMap
Voice traffic: Priority queue with strict priority
Video traffic: Bandwidth guaranteed, WFQ
Data traffic: Best effort, lower priority
end note

note bottom of Interface
Cisco IOS example commands:

class-map match-any VOICE
 match protocol rtp audio
class-map match-any VIDEO
 match protocol rtp video
policy-map QOS_POLICY
 class VOICE
  priority 1500
 class VIDEO
  bandwidth 2000
 class class-default
  fair-queue
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 service-policy output QOS_POLICY
