  rectangle "1. Identify Interface Facing Clients\nExample:\ninterface FastEthernet0/1\n ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0" as Step1
  rectangle "2. Configure DHCP Relay\nCommand:\nip helper-address 10.0.0.100" as Step2
  rectangle "3. Verify Other UDP Ports (Optional)\nHelper-address also forwards:\n - TFTP, DNS, NetBIOS, etc." as Step3

Client --> Router : DHCP Discover
Router --> DHCPServer : DHCP Forwarded (UDP 67)
DHCPServer --> Router : DHCP Offer
Router --> Client : DHCP Offer relayed

Router --> Config

note right of Step2
ip helper-address tells the router where to forward DHCP messages.
end note

note right of Step3
By default, the router forwards 8 UDP services.
You can limit them using:\nno ip forward-protocol udp [port]
end note

note right of Step4
Verify using:\nshow ip interface\nshow running-config
end note
