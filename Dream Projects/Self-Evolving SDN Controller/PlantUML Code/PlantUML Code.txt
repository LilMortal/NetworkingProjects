Admin --> AdminConsole : Configure and monitor network
AdminConsole --> PolicyManager : Define policies
PolicyManager --> PolicyEngine : Update enforcement rules
AdminConsole --> DeploymentEngine : Trigger config deployments

SDNSwitches --> SouthboundAPI : Report status & accept flow rules
SouthboundAPI --> SDNControllerCore : Interface for device communication

SouthboundAPI --> TopologyManager : Update topology info
TopologyManager --> FlowManager : Provide network context
FlowManager --> SDNSwitches : Install / remove flow entries

DataCollector --> NetworkMonitor : Provide telemetry data
NetworkMonitor --> AlertSystem : Send alerts on faults/anomalies
DataCollector --> BehaviorAnalyzer : Feed network data for analysis
BehaviorAnalyzer --> EvolutionEngine : Provide behavior insights
EvolutionEngine --> ReinforcementLearner : Collaborate for policy optimization
ReinforcementLearner --> PolicyManager : Suggest policy improvements

EvolutionEngine --> DeploymentEngine : Propose updated configurations
DeploymentEngine --> FlowManager : Apply evolved flow rules

AdminConsole --> NetworkMonitor : View network status & alerts

note right of EvolutionEngine
- Uses AI to adapt controller logic dynamically
- Learns from network behavior and feedback
end note

note right of ReinforcementLearner
- Uses RL to optimize policies for performance and security
- Continuously improves via trial and error
end note

note right of PolicyEngine
- Implements policies from admin and ML suggestions
- Enforces QoS, security, and traffic engineering
end note
