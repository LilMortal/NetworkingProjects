Devices --> TelemetryCollector : Send telemetry data
Services --> TelemetryCollector : Send service metrics and logs

TelemetryCollector --> AnomalyDetector : Provide telemetry data
AnomalyDetector --> RCA : Trigger diagnosis on anomaly
RCA --> HealingDecision : Provide root cause insights

MLModels --> AnomalyDetector : Support anomaly detection
MLModels --> RCA : Support root cause analysis
HealingDecision --> AutomationEngine : Issue healing commands

AutomationEngine --> Orchestrator : Execute healing actions
Orchestrator --> Devices : Apply config changes / restart / isolate
Orchestrator --> Services : Restart / reconfigure services

Orchestrator --> FeedbackLoop : Report healing outcome
FeedbackLoop --> HealingDecision : Feedback on effectiveness

Admin --> AdminConsole : Monitor system status and alerts
AdminConsole --> PolicyManager : Configure policies and thresholds
AdminConsole --> HealingDecision : Override or approve actions
AdminConsole --> TelemetryCollector : View raw telemetry

note right of AnomalyDetector
- Detects performance degradation, link failures, misconfigurations
- Uses ML models and threshold-based triggers
end note

note right of RCA
- Correlates events to find root cause
- Utilizes historical data and dependency maps
end note

note right of HealingDecision
- Chooses automated repair steps
- Prioritizes actions based on impact and confidence
end note

note right of AutomationEngine
- Orchestrates workflows such as device reboot, config rollback
- Integrates with network management APIs
end note

note right of FeedbackLoop
- Monitors post-healing network state
- Adjusts ML models and policies accordingly
end note
